You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

Hypothesis of the rule

- Colors: 0 = background. There are two non‑background field colors (here 3 and 4). The output introduces a new color 8.

- What changes: Every 0 that lies inside one of the colored fields (i.e., a “hole” in a 3- or 4-colored rectangular area) is turned into a marked spot and surrounded.

- Exact stamping:
  - Replace the hole’s center (the 0) with 8.
  - Paint the entire 3×3 neighborhood centered on that cell (excluding the center) with the opposite field color:
    - if the hole is in a 3-field, its 3×3 ring is 4;
    - if the hole is in a 4-field, its 3×3 ring is 3.
  - Clip the 3×3 stamp at the grid edge if needed.
  - If multiple stamps overlap, they simply merge (same ring color within the same field). Background 0 can be overwritten by a ring; only centers become 8.

- Everything else (background and field pixels not covered by any 3×3 stamp) remains unchanged.

This exactly explains:
- All scattered interior 0s become 8s.
- Around each, a 3×3 block of the opposite color appears, producing the yellow-on-green and green-on-yellow squares seen in the output.
- Background 0s stay 0 unless covered by a ring.

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

Refined rule (fits both training pairs)

- There are exactly two non‑background colors, call them A and B (first pair: 3 and 4; second pair: 1 and 2). The output introduces 8.

- Find “holes”: any 0 whose entire in‑bounds 3×3 neighborhood (excluding the center) is uniformly one nonzero color c. In other words, every existing neighbor is c; no neighbor is 0 or the other color. Edge cells can qualify if all existing neighbors are c.

- For each hole (center at p) in color c:
  - Set p to 8.
  - In the 3×3 window around p (excluding p), recolor only those cells that were c in the original grid to the opposite color c′. Do not paint background 0s or cells that were already c′.
  - Apply all stamps in parallel using the original grid as the mask; overlapping stamps just union their recolorings.

- Everything else remains unchanged.

Key correction from my previous attempt: rings are clipped to the original colored regions; background 0s are never overwritten by the ring. This produces the exact second output you provided and matches the first example as well.

Look at the visual representation below. Based on the consistent pattern you've identified from all the training examples, generate the output grid. 

You can use a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

IMPORTANT: Provide your answer as a grid in the exact same format, with square brackets and comma-separated values. Make sure the dimensions are correct.
