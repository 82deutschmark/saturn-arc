You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

Hypothesis after analyzing the first pair

What has semantic significance
- The big colored frame (4s, 6s, 5s) only serves to locate a “screen” inside it.
- The screen is the rectangular block whose background is 1 and that contains shapes in 8, 2, 3 plus some 0s.
- Colors are preserved; no recoloring happens.

Deterministic rule
1) Crop the screen: take the bounding box of the 1‑background region with its embedded 8/2/3/0 pixels. In this example that block is 15×11 (rows 5–19, cols 5–15 of the input).
2) Transform the cropped block by rotating 90° counter‑clockwise and then mirroring horizontally (left–right flip).
   - Equivalent coordinate rule for a block of size H×W: new_row = W+1−col, new_col = H+1−row.

Checks on this example
- The vertical column of 8s in the crop (at col 8) becomes the long horizontal bar of 8s on output row 4.
- The horizontal run of 8s (row 12 in the crop) becomes the vertical 8s in output column 4.
- The orange 2 cluster around (row 10, cols 6–7,9–10) maps to the orange L at column 6 and row 6 in the output.
- The small 0 notch at (row 1, col 8) maps to output (row 4, col 15), and the left‑edge 0s map to the bottom‑right 0s in the output.

So: output = crop the inner 1‑background panel, then rotate 90° CCW and flip horizontally.

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense.

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

Refined rule
- Find the inner rectangular “screen”: the maximal axis-aligned rectangle of a single background color that contains foreground pixels of other colors. The colors of the frame/outside are irrelevant.
- Crop exactly that screen.
- Rotate the cropped screen 90 degrees counter-clockwise. No mirroring. Colors are preserved.

Why my earlier guess failed
- I added an extra horizontal mirror. The second example shows that a plain 90° CCW rotation maps the two 8s from row 2, cols 8–9 of the crop to a vertical pair at (row 2–3, col 2) in the output, matching the ground truth.

Verification on the second example
- Cropped 10×10 screen (rows 7–16, cols 5–14) with background 2:
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]
  [2,4,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]
  [2,4,2,4,4,4,2,4,4,2]
  [2,4,2,4,2,4,2,4,2,2]
  [2,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,2,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]
- Rotate 90° CCW → exactly the given output:
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]
  [2,8,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2]
  [2,8,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2]
  [2,4,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,2]
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]

Consistency with the first example
- Crop the 15×11 screen (background 1) and rotate 90° CCW. The long vertical bar of 8s becomes a long horizontal bar (row 4), and the horizontal 8s become vertical—matching the provided output.

Final algorithm (deterministic)
1) Detect the largest rectangular region of uniform color that contains other colors inside (the screen).
2) Crop to that rectangle.
3) Rotate the crop 90° counter-clockwise.
4) Output the rotated crop.

This reproduces both training outputs exactly.

Great—example 3 fits the same transformation once we identify the correct “screen.”

Unified rule (now consistent across all three):
- Find the unique interior rectangular panel: the tight bounding box of a dense, mostly single-colored, non-zero region that contains other colors inside it. Colors are preserved.
- Crop exactly that panel.
- Rotate the crop 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
- Output the rotated crop.

Applied to example 3
- The panel is the 5×5 block dominated by 8s at rows 6–10, cols 5–9:
  8 8 8 8 8
  8 9 8 8 8
  8 9 8 8 8

Look at the visual representation below. Based on the consistent pattern you've identified from all the training examples, generate the output grid. 

You can use a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

IMPORTANT: Provide your answer as a grid in the exact same format, with square brackets and comma-separated values. Make sure the dimensions are correct.
