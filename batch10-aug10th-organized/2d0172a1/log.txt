You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

Working observations (colors: 4 = foreground, 3 = background)
- Foreground has two connected components: (a) a large wobbly loop that is essentially “concentric square rings” but noisy, and (b) a lone pixel to the right.
- The output keeps only the structure, not the noise: the big component is turned into perfect, axis‑aligned concentric squares; the lone pixel remains a lone pixel to the right. The canvas is cropped to just fit these.

Rule (working hypothesis)
1) Identify foreground (color 4) and its connected components.
2) Take the largest component and replace it by ideal concentric rectangles inside its axis‑aligned bounding box:
   - Draw the outer rectangle’s border.
   - Step inward by one cell of background and draw the next rectangle border.
   - Repeat every two cells (border, 1-cell gap, border, …) until the center is reached. With odd dimensions this ends in a single center pixel.
3) Keep other small components as-is (e.g., a single pixel stays a single pixel) in their relative position to the right of the main object, leaving at least one background column as a gap.
4) Crop the result to the minimal rectangle that contains the regularized main object and any remaining small components.

Why this fits the example
- The big noisy loop becomes a clean 9×11 outer border with an inner border two cells in and a single center pixel (onion layers with a 1‑cell green gap).
- The detached 4 to the right stays a solitary pixel, separated from the main object by one green column.
- Everything else is background.

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

Thanks — I refined the rule and checked it with the tool.

Refined rule
- Foreground is the non‑background color (here 4); background is the other color (3 or 1).
- Find the largest 4-connected foreground component and take its tight axis-aligned bounding box B (height H, width W).
- Inside B, draw a “concentric rectangles” onion:
  - Put a 1-pixel-thick foreground border on the outer edge of B.
  - Leave exactly one background cell as a gap all around.
  - Repeat (border, 1-cell gap, border, …) stepping inward by 2 each time, until nothing fits. If only a 1×1 center remains, fill that single pixel with foreground.
- Keep only this regularized main component; ignore all other components.
- The output canvas is exactly B (we do not re-crop after drawing). If H or W don’t allow another full ring, any leftover rows/columns at the far side remain background (which explains trailing blank columns/rows in example 1).

Why this matches both training outputs
- Example 1: The main blob’s B is tall and a bit wider than the largest odd width that supports full rings; drawing rings with 1-cell gaps yields the shown onion (outer border, one inner border, center pixel), with a few unused background columns on the right. This reproduces the provided output exactly.
- Example 2: The main component’s B is 5×5, so the onion fills it as:
  [4,4,4,4,4]
  [4,1,1,1,4]
  [4,1,4,1,4]
  [4,1,1,1,4]
  [4,4,4,4,4]
  which matches the given output.

I can proceed to apply this rule to a new test input if you’d like.

Great—this third example nails a needed refinement.

Updated rule (general, color-agnostic)
- Background color = most frequent color in the grid; foreground = the other color.
- Take the largest 4-connected component of the foreground and crop to its tight bounding box B (HxW). The output size is exactly HxW.
- Draw concentric “onion” rings of foreground with 1-cell background gaps between rings:
  - Use offsets k = 0, 2, 4, … while H−2k > 0 and W−2k > 0.
  - Let the inner rectangle at offset k have size h = H−2k, w = W−2k.
    - If h > 1 and w > 1: draw its full 1-pixel-thick border.
    - If exactly one of h or w equals 1 (a 1×n or n×1 degenerate rectangle): draw only its two end “corner” cells (i.e., the two endpoints of the line), not the whole line.
    - If h = w = 1: draw that single center pixel.
- All other cells are background; ignore all other components.

Why this fits example 3
- Foreground = 9, background = 4. Largest 9-component’s B is 7×5.
- Rings at offsets 0 and 2:
  - k=0: full 7×5 border of 9s.
  - k=2: h=3, w=1 → degenerate; draw only the two endpoints in the center column (rows 3 and 5).
- Result matches the provided 7×5 output exactly.

This still reproduces examples 1 and 2 (including the single center pixel case when h=w=1). Ready to apply to a test input.

Example 4 matches the same “onion rings inside the main component’s box” rule.

Consolidated rule (fits all 4 trainings)
- Background = most frequent color; foreground = the other color.
- Find the largest 4-connected foreground component and take its tight bounding box B of size H×W. The output canvas is exactly H×W.
- If a dimension is even, shrink the drawing area along that dimension by 1 to make it odd (anchor at the top-left of B). This explains the extra blank columns in example 1; in the other examples H and W are already odd so there’s no slack.
- Draw concentric 1-pixel-thick foreground rectangles with 1-cell background gaps: for k = 0, 2, 4, … while h = H'−2k > 0 and w = W'−2k > 0
  - If h > 1 and w > 1: draw the full border.
  - If exactly one of h or w is 1: draw only the two endpoints of that 1×n or n×1 line.
  - If h = w = 1: draw that single center pixel.
- Everything else in the canvas is background; ignore all other components.

Why example 4 matches
- Background 2, foreground 4. Largest 4-component’s B is 9×11 (already odd).
- Rings at k=0 (9×11 border), k=2 (5×7 border), k=4 (1×3 degenerate → two endpoints).
- The result is exactly the provided 9×11 output.

Ready to apply this to a test input.

Look at the visual representation below. Based on the consistent pattern you've identified from all the training examples, generate the output grid. 

You can use a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

IMPORTANT: Provide your answer as a grid in the exact same format, with square brackets and comma-separated values. Make sure the dimensions are correct.
