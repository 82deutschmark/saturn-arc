PHASE PROMPT TO OPENAI:

You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

Observations from the first pair:

- Certain single pixels act as “top‑left anchors” for 4×4 stamps. Anchors are colors 2, 3, and 5.
- The output is made entirely of new colors placed as 4×4 patterns starting at those anchors; all original nonzero pixels are otherwise cleared.
- Stamps do not overlap; an anchor is used only if the whole 4×4 box starting there is empty in the input (aside from the anchor pixel itself). This suppresses the lone 5 at (5,5).

Anchor → stamp (top‑left at the anchor):
- 2 → color 4: draw the full 4×4 border (a hollow square).
- 3 → color 1: draw the 4×4 border without the four corners (8 cells).
- 5 → color 6: fill the two 2×2 corner blocks on the main diagonal of that 4×4 (top‑left and bottom‑right).

Applying this:
- 2’s at (1,8), (1,13), (6,8), (6,13) produce the yellow 4×4 hollow squares.
- 5’s at (11,8), (11,13) produce magenta diagonal-corner pairs of 2×2.
- 3’s at (11,2), (16,2), (16,8), (16,13) produce blue “border-without-corners” rings.
- The 5 at (5,5) is ignored because its 4×4 box would include another nonzero input cell (the 2 at (6,8)).

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

Great catch — my earlier “4×4 box must be empty” condition was too strict. Here’s the refined rule set that reproduces both training outputs exactly.

What matters
- Anchors (primes): 2, 3, 5. Each is a top-left anchor for a 4×4 stamp.
- Stamp shapes and colors:
  - 2 → color 4: full 4×4 border (includes corners).
  - 3 → color 1: 4×4 border without the four corners.
  - 5 → color 6: the two 2×2 diagonal corners of the 4×4 (top-left and bottom-right).

How to apply
1) Start from a blank canvas (all zeros).
2) Process anchors in ascending value: 2, then 3, then 5.
3) For an anchor, skip it if the 4×4 would go off the grid.
4) Conflict rule: you can place a stamp only if every target cell of that stamp is currently either 0 or already the same color you want to place. If any target cell holds a different nonzero color, skip the entire stamp. No partial stamping.
5) Final output is exactly the union of all placed stamps; anything not stamped is 0 (so original nonzero pixels survive only if they lie on a placed stamp of the same color).

Why this matches both examples
- Example 1: All 2-anchors place hollow yellow squares. 3-anchors place blue rings. The 5 at (6,6) would write 6s into (rows 9–10, cols 9–10), but those cells already get 4s from the 2-anchor at (7,9); conflict → skip that 5 entirely. The other 5-anchors place their 6s. Original 6s in the top-left vanish because they aren’t covered by any placed stamp.
- Example 2: All four anchors at (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), (6,6) fit and don’t conflict, so they place as expected. The 3 at (6,6) writes its ring of 1s exactly where the input already had 1s — allowed because the target cells equal the stamp color. The 3 at (10,10) is off-grid → skipped. Result matches the provided output.

Refined rule set that fits all three training pairs:

- Anchors: cells with values 2, 3, 5. Each is the top‑left of a 4×4 stamp.
- Stamp shapes and colors:
  - 2 → color 4: full 4×4 hollow square (border including corners).
  - 3 → color 1: 4×4 border without the four corners.
  - 5 → color 6: two 2×2 corner blocks on the main diagonal of that 4×4 (top‑left and bottom‑right).
- Start from a blank canvas (ignore non‑anchor input colors).
- Validity of an anchor: its 4×4 must fit inside the grid and contain no other anchors (no 2/3/5) anywhere in its 4×4 region besides itself. Non‑anchor colors in the input don’t matter.
- Place all valid stamps; because of the validity rule, their 4×4 regions are disjoint, so no overlaps occur.

Why example 3 matches:
- Anchors: 2’s at (1,7), (5,5), (7,1), (7,7).
- (5,5) is invalid because its 4×4 region (rows 5–8, cols 5–8) contains another anchor at (7,7).
- The others are valid and place 4×4 hollow squares at (1,7), (7,1), and (7,7), exactly as in the provided output.

This keeps examples 1 and 2 correct and explains example 3.

Updated rule set (fits all four trainings):

- Anchors: cells with values 2, 3, 5, 8. Each is the top-left of a 4×4 stamp. All other input colors are ignored; start from a blank canvas.
- Mapping (anchor → output color/shape in its 4×4):
  - 2 → color 4: full 4×4 hollow square (border including corners).
  - 3 → color 1: border without the four corners.
  - 5 → color 6: two 2×2 blocks on the main diagonal (top-left and bottom-right).
  - 8 → color 7: four corners plus the central 2×2 block.
- Valid anchor:
  - Its 4×4 fits in-bounds, and
  - Its 4×4 region contains no other anchor (2/3/5/8) besides itself. If it contains another anchor anywhere, skip it. This resolves overlaps deterministically (only one of any overlapping pair places).
- Place all valid stamps; result is the union of these stamps.

Why example 4 matches:
- Anchors occur on a 4-step grid so every 4×4 is in-bounds and contains no other anchor; all stamps place.
- 2’s lay yellow hollow squares, 3’s lay blue borders-without-corners, 5’s lay magenta diagonal 2×2 corners, and 8’s lay orange corners+center. The tiling of these 4×4 stamps across the 20×20 board exactly reproduces the provided output.

This same procedure reproduces examples 1–3 (including skipping overlapping anchors like the 5 in example 1 and the (5,5) in example 3).

Look at the visual representation below. Based on the consistent pattern you've identified from all the training examples, generate the output grid. 

You can use a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

IMPORTANT: Provide your answer as a grid in the exact same format, with square brackets and comma-separated values. Make sure the dimensions are correct.
