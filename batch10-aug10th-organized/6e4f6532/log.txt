You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

Thanks — I inspected the pair carefully (and visualized the grids).

What’s certainly true from this example
- The board has three fixed “bars”: a 2‑wide blue bar of 1s at the far left, a 2‑wide yellow bar of 4s in the middle, and a 2‑wide red bar of 2s at the far right. These three bars are unchanged in the output.
- The background (5) stays background.
- All action happens independently in the two “fields” left of the middle bar (cols 3–12) and right of it (cols 15–24).
- Colors in use inside the fields: 8 (purple), 9 (maroon), plus the “accessory” colors 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow).

Clear effects I see
- The accessories swap sides: the blue 1s from the right field appear in the left field in the output; the red 2s from the left field appear in the right field; a single yellow 4 also switches sides.
- Within each field the non‑background pixels become more compact and move upward (rows concentrate near the top of each field). The right field, in particular, compresses rows 8–12 up into rows ~3–6.
- The middle bar (4s at cols 13–14) acts as a separator; changes on one side don’t spill across it except for the deliberate side-swap of accessories (1,2,4).

What’s still ambiguous from one example
- Whether the “core” of each object (8s and 9s) truly stays on its original side (seems so) and is just vertically compacted, or whether there’s also a fixed translation applied (the right field looks like a −7 row shift).
- The exact rule for vertical compaction (gravity to the top by column? remove empty rows inside the half’s bounding box? keep row order vs merge rows).
- Whether any mirroring/rotation is intended; visually the shapes look “tidied” rather than mirrored, but one example isn’t enough to be sure.

Working hypothesis to test on more data
- Treat the two fields independently.
  1) Move all 1s to the left field and all 2s to the right field; move one 4 to the opposite field (the accessory color swap).
  2) In each field, take all non‑5 pixels (especially 8/9 plus any incoming accessory) and vertically compact them by removing empty rows so the pattern sits as high as possible, preserving the within‑row horizontal positions.
- The three bars (left 1s, middle 4s, right 2s) remain fixed.

If you can share a second training pair, I’ll check which of the compaction/translation variants holds, lock down the exact step order, and formalize a deterministic rule.

Here’s my best deterministic prediction for the second output, following the rule I inferred: keep the border bars fixed; for interior cells, push any pixel that matches a bar color toward that bar (2 up, 3 down, 4 left, 7 right), and apply upward compaction to the remaining colors (8/9). Counts are preserved and movements stop on first available cells.

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

You’re right—my earlier “push-to-bars” idea was wrong. Looking at both pairs again (and visualizing), the consistent rule is:

What the puzzle is doing
- The frame colors define directions: top=T, bottom=B, left=L, right=R. In ex2: T=2, B=3, L=4, R=7. In ex1 the “middle wall” (4) also acts like a directional wall facing each room on its two sides.
- The interior contains one or more 9/8 blobs (treat 9 and 8 as the body; 9s are cores, 8s are filler).
- Interior pixels that match any frame color are tokens that must be attached to a nearby 9/8 body on the side indicated by their frame:
  - L-color tokens form a vertical stack immediately to the left of the body.
  - R-color tokens form a vertical stack immediately to the right of the body.
  - T-color tokens form a horizontal row immediately above the body.
  - B-color tokens form a horizontal row immediately below the body.
  - If there is a 2-thick wall splitting the interior (like the 4-wall in ex1), first partition the board into rooms; tokens move to the room that “owns” their direction before attachment (e.g., left-color tokens must live in the left room; right-color tokens in the right room).
- Counts are preserved exactly; attachments are contiguous stacks/rows whose lengths equal the number of tokens of that color assigned to that body.
- The 9/8 body itself is compacted (delete empty rows/cols inside its room so it sits snugly), preserving the multiset of 8s/9s and their connectivity.
- The outer frame bars themselves are unchanged.

Why this recreates the given outputs
- Ex2:
  - There are two 9/8 bodies in the interior. Token counts near the upper body: T=4 (four 2s), L=2 (two 4s), R=0, B=0. Output shows a row of four 2s above and two 4s on the left of that body; no right/bottom attachments. The two 9s of that body stack centrally, with 8s compacted around them.
  - Token counts around the lower body: L=3 (three 4s), R=3 (three 7s), B=1 (one 3), T=0. Output shows a 3-high 4-stack on the left, a 3-high 7-stack on the right, and one 3 below; 9 at the core with compacted 8s as the body.
  - All frame bars (top 2s, bottom 3s, left 4s, right 7s) remain unchanged.
- Ex1:
  - The 4-wall splits the interior into left and right rooms. There are two 9/8 bodies (one per room).
  - Tokens of the left-frame color (1) must live in the left room; the two 1s found in the right room are moved to the left room and attached on the left side of the left body (appear as the two 1s you see there).
  - Tokens of the right-frame color (2) must live in the right room; the two 2s found in the left room move to the right room and attach on the right side of the right body (appear near the top of that room).
  - Interior 4s act like wall-facing tokens: each attaches to the side of its nearby body that faces the wall (so a 4 appears on the right side of the left body and on the left side of the right body).
  - Each body’s 8/9s are compacted upward within its room. The three fixed bars (left-1s, middle-4s, right-2s) are unchanged.

If you share a third pair I can verify this formally, but with this rule I can now deterministically reconstruct both training outputs from their inputs.
