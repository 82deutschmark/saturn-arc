You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

Input grid:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Key idea
- The red column (2) is a fixed vertical divider.
- For each row, look strictly to the left of the red column and find the rightmost non‑zero monochrome run (the contiguous block of a single color closest to the red column; it may or may not touch the column).
- Let that run’s color be C and its length be L.
- To the right of the red column, paint single cells of color C starting immediately one cell to the right of the column and then every L cells after that (i.e., positions red_col+1 + k·L), stopping at the grid edge.
- All other cells remain unchanged.

What matters
- Color identity C of the rightmost non‑zero run on the left.
- Length L of that run.
- The red column acts only as a divider; its color value doesn’t propagate.
- Absolute position of the left run (how far from the left edge or whether there’s a gap of zeros before the divider) does not matter.

Checks on the example
- Row 4: last left run = four 1s (L=4, C=1) → 1s at cols 7,11,15.
- Row 6: last left run = one 8 (L=1, C=8) → every cell on the right becomes 8.
- Row 8: last left run = five 3s (L=5, C=3) → 3s at cols 7,12.
- Row 10: last left run = four 5s (L=4, C=5) → 5s at cols 7,11,15.

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

Great catch. My first rule was incomplete. Here’s the refined, deterministic rule that matches both training examples:

Rule (per row)
- Let the red column (value 2) be a divider.
- Parse the segment strictly to the left of the divider into contiguous non-zero runs. For each run i, note its color Ci and length Li. Ignore zeros.
- On the right of the divider, starting at the first cell to the right, paint color Ci at positions start + k·Li (k = 0,1,2,…) within the row.
- If multiple runs paint the same cell, the run closer to the divider (the later run on the left) wins and overwrites earlier ones.

What has semantic significance
- Each non-zero run’s color and its length.
- Relative order of runs (priority: rightmost > … > leftmost).
- The red divider is just a boundary; if a 2 appears as a left run color, treat it like any other color.

Verification on the two training examples

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Why the earlier miss
- I only used the last run. The correct rule uses all non-zero runs on the left, with priority given to runs closer to the divider.

Ready for the test example.

Example 3 confirms the refined rule:

Per row:
- Treat the 2-column as a divider.
- On the left of it, find all non-zero contiguous runs; for each run i with color Ci and length Li, paint Ci on the right at positions (divider+1) + k·Li (k = 0,1,2,…). If multiple runs hit the same cell, the rightmost-left run has priority.

Checks on example 3:
- Row 2: left runs = [1,1] (L=2) → 1 at cols 5,7,9,11,13,15.
- Row 6: left run = [5] (L=1) → every right cell becomes 5.
- Row 10: left run = [7,7,7] (L=3) → 7 at cols 5,8,11,14.
- Other rows have no non-zero left runs → right side unchanged.
