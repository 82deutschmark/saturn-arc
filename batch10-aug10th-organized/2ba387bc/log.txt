You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them.

Key regularities from the training example

- Objects: connected mono‑colored squares. Each object’s bounding box is about 4×4; some are solid fills, some are hollow frames (border-only). One object (color 1) is 3×4 but still a solid fill.
- Semantic property that matters: solidity vs hollow. Color is preserved; exact original size/position doesn’t matter beyond ordering.
- Output layout: a canonical mosaic of 4×4 tiles, 2 columns wide.
  - Left column: all hollow objects.
  - Right column: all solid objects.
  - Within each column, objects are ordered from top to bottom by their vertical position (topmost first) in the input.
  - If one column has fewer objects, its remaining 4×4 tile(s) are left as zeros.
  - Each tile is rendered canonically:
    - Solid → 4×4 full block in that object’s color.
    - Hollow → 4×4 frame (border) in that object’s color with a 2×2 zero hole.

How this explains the example

- Hollow in input (top→bottom): 8, 3, 4 → placed in the left column, rows 1–3; row 4 left is empty.
- Solid in input (top→bottom): 1, 2, 7, 6 → placed in the right column, rows 1–4.
- Colors are unchanged; the 3×4 block of 1’s is normalized to a 4×4 full tile.

Procedure to apply on new inputs

1) Find connected components by color.
2) For each component, examine the interior of its bounding box (excluding border):
   - If interior is all zeros → hollow; else → solid.
3) Record each component’s topmost row (for ordering).
4) Sort hollows and solids separately by that topmost row.
5) Build the output grid with height 4×max(#hollows, #solids) and width 8 (two 4×4 columns).
6) Fill left column with hollow 4×4 frames in order; fill right column with solid 4×4 fills in order; leave any leftover tiles as zeros.

Ready for the next example or the test input.

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

Great—our rule is consistent and reproduces both training outputs.

Refined rule
- Parse connected components.
- Classify each as hollow (border with empty interior) or solid (filled).
- Order within each class by topmost position in the input.
- Assemble an output of width 8 as stacked 4×4 tiles:
  - Left column: hollow tiles (4×4 border with 2×2 hole) in order.
  - Right column: solid tiles (4×4 filled) in order.
  - Height = 4 × max(#hollow, #solid); unused tiles are zeros.

Tool check
- I visualized the canonical outputs for both training examples with the tool; they match exactly the provided outputs.

Ready for the test input.

Confirmed: the same rule produces the given output for training example 3.

- Detected objects: 8 (hollow), 4 (solid), 2 (solid), 7 (hollow).
- Order by topmost within each class:
  - Hollow → [8, 7] → left column.
  - Solid → [4, 2] → right column.
- Render as 4×4 tiles; height 8. This yields exactly the provided output.

Confirmed—example 4 also follows the same rule.

- Hollow objects (topmost first): 2, 8, 6 → placed in the left column.
- Solid objects (topmost first): 3, 4 → placed in the right column.
- Output height = 4 × max(3, 2) = 12; bottom-right 4×4 tile is zeros.

This yields exactly the provided output. Ready for the test input.

Look at the visual representation below. Based on the consistent pattern you've identified from all the training examples, generate the output grid. 

You can use a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

IMPORTANT: Provide your answer as a grid in the exact same format, with square brackets and comma-separated values. Make sure the dimensions are correct.
