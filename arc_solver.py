"""We have a fun little puzzle here. Think about this puzzle visually. Every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Describe how the transformations happen. Don't think deeply about it, just generate 100 one sentence transformations that describe how the pixels move and flow. Use visual words to describe the data as if it were an image. For example, light pixels move up. Dark pixels consume blobs. Green pixels transmit from one item to another. And so on. The descriptions should be reasonable for the data, but not necessarily correct. We are just trying to find *possible* patterns that we can chose from later when building an algorithm.

Now we need to filter these descriptions of transformations and abstract them. Do not encode specific sizes or values. You may see data with different colors and larger or smaller boards. You need to reason about this abstractly in a way that allows you to solve novel inputs. Describe rules at the highest possible level of abstraction while still ensuring you capture the core transformations.

These problems have many aspects that you need to consider rules for. How data moves and flows is just one of them. You also need to determine things like the size of the grid, the layout, components that exist in the grid, how those components interact with each other. Some problems may appear to change over time as blobs move or consume one another. Other problems may be set up completely differently (e.g. simple rotations). There are many factors you need to consider, some related, some independent. Think of every pattern that exists in both test inputs and only patterns that exist in both inputs. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input. Continue thinking of transformations, rules, and patterns until you capture all transformations and properties of the board (making sure they can be applied to both inputs). Every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible.

Do not create mathematical heuristics to determine properties of the board. You can reference abstract concepts like "background color" for example. To determine these abstract concepts, again, do not apply mathematical heuristics. You should be able to just read the input as an image, and *see* the background color. *Think* about what the board *looks* like instead of encoding patterns or algorithms. Don't generate code or run algorithms. These are not complex problems with big inputs. You should be able to find all the information you need (e.g. background color) by just looking at the input.

Here's the inputs and outputs of the pattern: """,

    "Think of 12 ways to solve this puzzle. Each way should be a pattern you can think of. Think outside the box. We are brainstorming and brute forcing, so anything goes, it doesn't need to make sense. Dig deep, think of every crazy solution you can. Create a short description of the pattern/solution and then score it by likeliness to succeed (score: 0-10) and order them by likeliness to succeed.",
    
    "Take the top 4 most likely solutions. Think of permutations and combinations of these. If you see missing likely patterns, add those as well. Let's create a new list of 8 possible algorithms that include the most likely and any reasonable permutations. Feel free to also reference the other patterns or create new patterns if you think they'd make a good solution. When you are done, score the algorithms by most likely (score: 0-10) and order them by likeliness to succeed. Try running some of the patterns through the test data to help determine which might contribute to a good algorithm.",
    
    "Think of permutations and combinations of the generated algorithms. If you think of a new algorithm, add that as well. Let's create a new list of 3 possible algorithms based on the highest scoring algorithms from before, any reasonable permutations, and any new algorithms you can think of. Feel free to also reference the other patterns or create new patterns if you think they'd contribute to a good solution. When you are done, score the algorithms by most likely (score: 0-10) and order them by likeliness to succeed. Try running some of the patterns through the test data to help determine which might contribute to a good algorithm. Think deeply about the problem and test your theories by applying generated algorithms to the input data. Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.",
    
    "Take the algorithm with the most potential and apply it to the input data. Check the output of your algorithm against the expected result and make sure it matches exactly. If it does not match, continue updating the algorithm until you find one that does match. Reference previous algorithms and patterns you thought of. If you eventually find an algorithm that always produces the correct output exactly, explain the algorithm and end the message with **PATTERN FOUND**. If testing the pattern does not result in success, end the message with **PATTERN FAILED**. Use these phrases exactly to signal success or failure."

If testing the pattern does not result in success, that is OK, but end the message with **PATTERN FAILED**.
