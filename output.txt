💬 Response text: Key regularities from the training example

- Objects: connected mono‑colored squares. Each object’s bounding box is about 4×4; some are solid fills, some are hollow frames (border-only). One object (color 1) is 3×4 but still a solid fill.
- Semantic property that matters: solidity vs hollow. Color is preserved; exact original size/position doesn’t matter beyond ordering.
- Output layout: a canonical mosaic of 4×4 tiles, 2 columns wide.
  - Left column: all hollow objects.
  - Right column: all solid objects.
  - Within each column, objects are ordered from top to bottom by their vertical position (topmost first) in the input.
  - If one column has fewer objects, its remaining 4×4 tile(s) are left as zeros.
  - Each tile is rendered canonically:
    - Solid → 4×4 full block in that object’s color.
    - Hollow → 4×4 frame (border) in that object’s color with a 2×2 zero hole.

How this explains the example

- Hollow in input (top→bottom): 8, 3, 4 → placed in the left column, rows 1–3; row 4 left is empty.
- Solid in input (top→bottom): 1, 2, 7, 6 → placed in the right column, rows 1–4.
- Colors are unchanged; the 3×4 block of 1’s is normalized to a 4×4 full tile.

Procedure to apply on new inputs

1) Find connected components by color.
2) For each component, examine the interior of its bounding box (excluding border):
   - If interior is all zeros → hollow; else → solid.
3) Record each component’s topmost row (for ordering).
4) Sort hollows and solids separately by that topmos...

You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them.

Key regularities from the training example

- Objects: connected mono‑colored squares. Each object’s bounding box is about 4×4; some are solid fills, some are hollow frames (border-only). One object (color 1) is 3×4 but still a solid fill.
- Semantic property that matters: solidity vs hollow. Color is preserved; exact original size/position doesn’t matter beyond ordering.
- Output layout: a canonical mosaic of 4×4 tiles, 2 columns wide.
  - Left column: all hollow objects.
  - Right column: all solid objects.
  - Within each column, objects are ordered from top to bottom by their vertical position (topmost first) in the input.
  - If one column has fewer objects, its remaining 4×4 tile(s) are left as zeros.
  - Each tile is rendered canonically:
    - Solid → 4×4 full block in that object’s color.
    - Hollow → 4×4 frame (border) in that object’s color with a 2×2 zero hole.

How this explains the example

- Hollow in input (top→bottom): 8, 3, 4 → placed in the left column, rows 1–3; row 4 left is empty.
- Solid in input (top→bottom): 1, 2, 7, 6 → placed in the right column, rows 1–4.
- Colors are unchanged; the 3×4 block of 1’s is normalized to a 4×4 full tile.

Procedure to apply on new inputs

1) Find connected components by color.
2) For each component, examine the interior of its bounding box (excluding border):
   - If interior is all zeros → hollow; else → solid.
3) Record each component’s topmost row (for ordering).
4) Sort hollows and solids separately by that topmost row.
5) Build the output grid with height 4×max(#hollows, #solids) and width 8 (two 4×4 columns).
6) Fill left column with hollow 4×4 frames in order; fill right column with solid 4×4 fills in order; leave any leftover tiles as zeros.

💬 Response text: Key objects and semantics
- 1 = blue frame (the walls of a 4x4 “room”).
- 8 = background.
- Each room has a 2x2 colored core with value c in {2..9}. That value is the room’s label/color.
- The bottom row (row 18 here) lists a sequence of labels; this is the route to draw.

Rule (deterministic)
For each consecutive pair (a, b) in the bottom sequence:
1) Find the unique room labeled a that is axis-aligned (same row or same column) with a room labeled b. If a label appears more than once, choose the one that is aligned with b (this is unique in the puzzle layouts).
2) Draw a 2-cell-thick straight corridor on the background between the two rooms:
   - Horizontal if the rooms are in the same row; vertical if in the same column.
   - The corridor occupies only the gap cells (8’s) between their frames; do not overwrite 1’s.
   - Color of the corridor = a (the source label).
Repeat for all pairs; frames and room interiors stay unchanged.

How it explains the example
Bottom sequence: 2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5
- 2→3: vertical 2’s connect top-left 2 to middle-left 3.
- 3→9: horizontal 3’s connect middle-left 3 to middle-center 9.
- 9→4: vertical 9’s connect middle-center 9 to bottom-center 4.
- 4→2: horizontal 4’s connect bottom-center 4 to bottom-right 2.
- 2→6: vertical 2’s connect bottom-right 2 to middle-right 6.
- 6→7: vertical 6’s connect middle-right 6 to top-right 7.
- 7→5: horizontal 7’s connect top-right 7 to top-center 5.

You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Key objects and semantics
- 1 = blue frame (the walls of a 4x4 “room”).
- 8 = background.
- Each room has a 2x2 colored core with value c in {2..9}. That value is the room’s label/color.
- The bottom row (row 18 here) lists a sequence of labels; this is the route to draw.

Rule (deterministic)
For each consecutive pair (a, b) in the bottom sequence:
1) Find the unique room labeled a that is axis-aligned (same row or same column) with a room labeled b. If a label appears more than once, choose the one that is aligned with b (this is unique in the puzzle layouts).
2) Draw a 2-cell-thick straight corridor on the background between the two rooms:
   - Horizontal if the rooms are in the same row; vertical if in the same column.
   - The corridor occupies only the gap cells (8’s) between their frames; do not overwrite 1’s.
   - Color of the corridor = a (the source label).
Repeat for all pairs; frames and room interiors stay unchanged.

How it explains the example
Bottom sequence: 2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5
- 2→3: vertical 2’s connect top-left 2 to middle-left 3.
- 3→9: horizontal 3’s connect middle-left 3 to middle-center 9.
- 9→4: vertical 9’s connect middle-center 9 to bottom-center 4.
- 4→2: horizontal 4’s connect bottom-center 4 to bottom-right 2.
- 2→6: vertical 2’s connect bottom-right 2 to middle-right 6.
- 6→7: vertical 6’s connect middle-right 6 to top-right 7.
- 7→5: horizontal 7’s connect top-right 7 to top-center 5.

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

💬 Response text: Working observations (colors: 4 = foreground, 3 = background)
- Foreground has two connected components: (a) a large wobbly loop that is essentially “concentric square rings” but noisy, and (b) a lone pixel to the right.
- The output keeps only the structure, not the noise: the big component is turned into perfect, axis‑aligned concentric squares; the lone pixel remains a lone pixel to the right. The canvas is cropped to just fit these.

Rule (working hypothesis)
1) Identify foreground (color 4) and its connected components.
2) Take the largest component and replace it by ideal concentric rectangles inside its axis‑aligned bounding box:
   - Draw the outer rectangle’s border.
   - Step inward by one cell of background and draw the next rectangle border.
   - Repeat every two cells (border, 1-cell gap, border, …) until the center is reached. With odd dimensions this ends in a single center pixel.
3) Keep other small components as-is (e.g., a single pixel stays a single pixel) in their relative position to the right of the main object, leaving at least one background column as a gap.
4) Crop the result to the minimal rectangle that contains the regularized main object and any remaining small components.

Why this fits the example
- The big noisy loop becomes a clean 9×11 outer border with an inner border two cells in and a single center pixel (onion layers with a 1‑cell green gap).
- The detached 4 to the right stays a solitary pixel, separated from the main object by one green...

💬 Response text: Thanks — I inspected the pair carefully (and visualized the grids).

What’s certainly true from this example
- The board has three fixed “bars”: a 2‑wide blue bar of 1s at the far left, a 2‑wide yellow bar of 4s in the middle, and a 2‑wide red bar of 2s at the far right. These three bars are unchanged in the output.

- All action happens independently in the two “fields” left of the middle bar (cols 3–12) and right of it (cols 15–24).
- Colors in use inside the fields: 8 (purple), 9 (maroon), plus the “accessory” colors 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow).

Clear effects I see
- The accessories swap sides: the blue 1s from the right field appear in the left field in the output; the red 2s from the left field appear in the right field; a single yellow 4 also switches sides.
- Within each field the non‑background pixels become more compact and move upward (rows concentrate near the top of each field). The right field, in particular, compresses rows 8–12 up into rows ~3–6.
- The middle bar (4s at cols 13–14) acts as a separator; changes on one side don’t spill across it except for the deliberate side-swap of accessories (1,2,4).

What’s still ambiguous from one example
- Whether the “core” of each object (8s and 9s) truly stays on its original side (seems so) and is just vertically compacted, or whether there’s also a fixed translation applied (the right field looks like a −7 row shift).

You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

Thanks — I inspected the pair carefully (and visualized the grids).

What’s certainly true from this example
- The board has three fixed “bars”: a 2‑wide blue bar of 1s at the far left, a 2‑wide yellow bar of 4s in the middle, and a 2‑wide red bar of 2s at the far right. These three bars are unchanged in the output.
- The background (5) stays background.
- All action happens independently in the two “fields” left of the middle bar (cols 3–12) and right of it (cols 15–24).
- Colors in use inside the fields: 8 (purple), 9 (maroon), plus the “accessory” colors 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow).

Clear effects I see
- The accessories swap sides: the blue 1s from the right field appear in the left field in the output; the red 2s from the left field appear in the right field; a single yellow 4 also switches sides.
- Within each field the non‑background pixels become more compact and move upward (rows concentrate near the top of each field). The right field, in particular, compresses rows 8–12 up into rows ~3–6.
- The middle bar (4s at cols 13–14) acts as a separator; changes on one side don’t spill across it except for the deliberate side-swap of accessories (1,2,4).

What’s still ambiguous from one example
- Whether the “core” of each object (8s and 9s) truly stays on its original side (seems so) and is just vertically compacted, or whether there’s also a fixed translation applied (the right field looks like a −7 row shift).
- The exact rule for vertical compaction (gravity to the top by column? remove empty rows inside the half’s bounding box? keep row order vs merge rows).
- Whether any mirroring/rotation is intended; visually the shapes look “tidied” rather than mirrored, but one example isn’t enough to be sure.

Working hypothesis to test on more data
- Treat the two fields independently.
  1) Move all 1s to the left field and all 2s to the right field; move one 4 to the opposite field (the accessory color swap).
  2) In each field, take all non‑5 pixels (especially 8/9 plus any incoming accessory) and vertically compact them by removing empty rows so the pattern sits as high as possible, preserving the within‑row horizontal positions.
- The three bars (left 1s, middle 4s, right 2s) remain fixed.

If you can share a second training pair, I’ll check which of the compaction/translation variants holds, lock down the exact step order, and formalize a deterministic rule.

💬 Response text: Observations from the first pair:

- Certain single pixels act as “top‑left anchors” for 4×4 stamps. Anchors are colors 2, 3, and 5.
- The output is made entirely of new colors placed as 4×4 patterns starting at those anchors; all original nonzero pixels are otherwise cleared.
- Stamps do not overlap; an anchor is used only if the whole 4×4 box starting there is empty in the input (aside from the anchor pixel itself). This suppresses the lone 5 at (5,5).

Anchor → stamp (top‑left at the anchor):
- 2 → color 4: draw the full 4×4 border (a hollow square).
- 3 → color 1: draw the 4×4 border without the four corners (8 cells).
- 5 → color 6: fill the two 2×2 corner blocks on the main diagonal of that 4×4 (top‑left and bottom‑right).

Applying this:
- 2’s at (1,8), (1,13), (6,8), (6,13) produce the yellow 4×4 hollow squares.
- 5’s at (11,8), (11,13) produce magenta diagonal-corner pairs of 2×2.
- 3’s at (11,2), (16,2), (16,8), (16,13) produce blue “border-without-corners” rings.
- The 5 at (5,5) is ignored because its 4×4 box would include another nonzero input cell (the 2 at (6,8))....

You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

💬 Response text: Hypothesis of the rule

- Colors: 0 = background. There are two non‑background field colors (here 3 and 4). The output introduces a new color 8.

- What changes: Every 0 that lies inside one of the colored fields (i.e., a “hole” in a 3- or 4-colored rectangular area) is turned into a marked spot and surrounded.

- Exact stamping:
  - Replace the hole’s center (the 0) with 8.
  - Paint the entire 3×3 neighborhood centered on that cell (excluding the center) with the opposite field color:
    - if the hole is in a 3-field, its 3×3 ring is 4;
    - if the hole is in a 4-field, its 3×3 ring is 3.
  - Clip the 3×3 stamp at the grid edge if needed.
  - If multiple stamps overlap, they simply merge (same ring color within the same field). Background 0 can be overwritten by a ring; only centers become 8.

- Everything else (background and field pixels not covered by any 3×3 stamp) remains unchanged.

This exactly explains:
- All scattered interior 0s become 8s.
- Around each, a 3×3 block of the opposite color appears, producing the yellow-on-green and green-on-yellow squares seen in the output.
- Background 0s stay 0 unless covered by a ring....

You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

Hypothesis of the rule

- Colors: 0 = background. There are two non‑background field colors (here 3 and 4). The output introduces a new color 8.

- What changes: Every 0 that lies inside one of the colored fields (i.e., a “hole” in a 3- or 4-colored rectangular area) is turned into a marked spot and surrounded.

- Exact stamping:
  - Replace the hole’s center (the 0) with 8.
  - Paint the entire 3×3 neighborhood centered on that cell (excluding the center) with the opposite field color:
    - if the hole is in a 3-field, its 3×3 ring is 4;
    - if the hole is in a 4-field, its 3×3 ring is 3.
  - Clip the 3×3 stamp at the grid edge if needed.
  - If multiple stamps overlap, they simply merge (same ring color within the same field). Background 0 can be overwritten by a ring; only centers become 8.

- Everything else (background and field pixels not covered by any 3×3 stamp) remains unchanged.

This exactly explains:
- All scattered interior 0s become 8s.
- Around each, a 3×3 block of the opposite color appears, producing the yellow-on-green and green-on-yellow squares seen in the output.
- Background 0s stay 0 unless covered by a ring.

💬 Response text: Thanks. The rule from example 1 does work for example 2 as well; I’ll refine it so it generalizes.

Refined rule
- Rooms: squares framed by 1’s. Inside each frame is a k×k solid block with label c (2–9). k can vary (k=2 in example 1, k=1 in example 2).
- Route: the bottom “sequence row” lists the labels left-to-right (ignore 8’s). Consider consecutive pairs (a,b).
- For each pair (a → b):
  1) Pick the unique room containing a that is axis-aligned with a room containing b and separated only by background 8’s (same row ⇒ horizontal gap; same column ⇒ vertical gap).
  2) Draw a straight corridor across that gap:
     - Orientation: horizontal if same row, vertical if same column.
     - Thickness: k of the source room a (matches the size of its interior block).
     - Color/value: a (the source label).
     - Only paint the background 8’s; never overwrite 1’s (frames) or any room interiors.

This produces exactly the provided outputs on both training examples. I’ve visualized the two correct outputs above to confirm.

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

💬 Response text: Great — example 3 matches the same rule and confirms the generalization.

What carries semantic significance
- 1 = wall (room frame).
- 8 = background.
- Each room has a solid k×k interior of a label c ∈ {2..9}; k can vary (ex1 k=2, ex2/3 k=1). The label c is the color used when that room is the source.
- The bottom “sequence row” (ignore 8’s) gives the route of labels to connect in order.

Deterministic rule
For each consecutive pair (a → b) in the sequence:
- Find the unique room with label a that is axis-aligned with a room labeled b and separated only by background 8’s (same row ⇒ horizontal gap, same column ⇒ vertical gap).
- Draw a straight corridor across just that gap:
  - Orientation: horizontal if same row, vertical if same column.
  - Thickness: k of the source room a (size of a’s interior).
  - Paint only 8’s; never overwrite 1’s or any room interiors.

How example 3 follows
Sequence: 3,2,9,4,6,7
- 3→2: horizontal 3’s between the top-left and top-middle rooms.
- 2→9: horizontal 2’s between the top-middle and top-right rooms.
- 9→4: vertical 9’s down the one-row gap between the top-right and mid-right rooms.
- 4→6: horizontal 4’s between mid-right and mid-left rooms.
- 6→7: vertical 6’s down the long gap to the bottom room.

This reproduces the provided output exactly and is consistent with examples 1 and 2. I’m ready to apply the rule to your test grid....

Great — example 3 matches the same rule and confirms the generalization.

What carries semantic significance
- 1 = wall (room frame).
- 8 = background.
- Each room has a solid k×k interior of a label c ∈ {2..9}; k can vary (ex1 k=2, ex2/3 k=1). The label c is the color used when that room is the source.
- The bottom “sequence row” (ignore 8’s) gives the route of labels to connect in order.

Deterministic rule
For each consecutive pair (a → b) in the sequence:
- Find the unique room with label a that is axis-aligned with a room labeled b and separated only by background 8’s (same row ⇒ horizontal gap, same column ⇒ vertical gap).
- Draw a straight corridor across just that gap:
  - Orientation: horizontal if same row, vertical if same column.
  - Thickness: k of the source room a (size of a’s interior).
  - Paint only 8’s; never overwrite 1’s or any room interiors.

How example 3 follows
Sequence: 3,2,9,4,6,7
- 3→2: horizontal 3’s between the top-left and top-middle rooms.
- 2→9: horizontal 2’s between the top-middle and top-right rooms.
- 9→4: vertical 9’s down the one-row gap between the top-right and mid-right rooms.
- 4→6: horizontal 4’s between mid-right and mid-left rooms.
- 6→7: vertical 6’s down the long gap to the bottom room.

This reproduces the provided output exactly and is consistent with examples 1 and 2. I’m ready to apply the rule to your test grid.

💬 Response text: Thanks — I refined the rule and checked it with the tool.

Refined rule
- Foreground is the non‑background color (here 4); background is the other color (3 or 1).
- Find the largest 4-connected foreground component and take its tight axis-aligned bounding box B (height H, width W).
- Inside B, draw a “concentric rectangles” onion:
  - Put a 1-pixel-thick foreground border on the outer edge of B.
  - Leave exactly one background cell as a gap all around.

- Keep only this regularized main component; ignore all other components.
- The output canvas is exactly B (we do not re-crop after drawing). If H or W don’t allow another full ring, any leftover rows/columns at the far side remain background (which explains trailing blank columns/rows in example 1).

Why this matches both training outputs
- Example 1: The main blob’s B is tall and a bit wider than the largest odd width that supports full rings; drawing rings with 1-cell gaps yields the shown onion (outer border, one inner border, center pixel), with a few unused background columns on the right. This reproduces the provided output exactly.
- Example 2: The main component’s B is 5×5, so the onion fills it as:
  [4,4,4,4,4]
  [4,1,1,1,4]
  [4,1,4,1,4]
  [4,1,1,1,4]

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

Thanks — I refined the rule and checked it with the tool.

Refined rule
- Foreground is the non‑background color (here 4); background is the other color (3 or 1).
- Find the largest 4-connected foreground component and take its tight axis-aligned bounding box B (height H, width W).
- Inside B, draw a “concentric rectangles” onion:
  - Put a 1-pixel-thick foreground border on the outer edge of B.
  - Leave exactly one background cell as a gap all around.
  - Repeat (border, 1-cell gap, border, …) stepping inward by 2 each time, until nothing fits. If only a 1×1 center remains, fill that single pixel with foreground.
- Keep only this regularized main component; ignore all other components.
- The output canvas is exactly B (we do not re-crop after drawing). If H or W don’t allow another full ring, any leftover rows/columns at the far side remain background (which explains trailing blank columns/rows in example 1).

  which matches the given output.

I can proceed to apply this rule to a new test input if you’d like.

💬 Response text: Great catch — my earlier “4×4 box must be empty” condition was too strict. Here’s the refined rule set that reproduces both training outputs exactly.

What matters
- Anchors (primes): 2, 3, 5. Each is a top-left anchor for a 4×4 stamp.
- Stamp shapes and colors:
  - 2 → color 4: full 4×4 border (includes corners).
  - 3 → color 1: 4×4 border without the four corners.
  - 5 → color 6: the two 2×2 diagonal corners of the 4×4 (top-left and bottom-right).

How to apply
1) Start from a blank canvas (all zeros).
2) Process anchors in ascending value: 2, then 3, then 5.
3) For an anchor, skip it if the 4×4 would go off the grid.
4) Conflict rule: you can place a stamp only if every target cell of that stamp is currently either 0 or already the same color you want to place. If any target cell holds a different nonzero color, skip the entire stamp. No partial stamping.
5) Final output is exactly the union of all placed stamps; anything not stamped is 0 (so original nonzero pixels survive only if they lie on a placed stamp of the same color).

Why this matches both examples
- Example 1: All 2-anchors place hollow yellow squares. 3-anchors place blue rings. The 5 at (6,6) would write 6s into (rows 9–10, cols 9–10), but those cells already get 4s from the 2-anchor at (7,9); conflict → skip that 5 entirely. The other 5-anchors place their 6s. Original 6s in the top-left vanish because they aren’t covered by any placed stamp.
- Example 2: All four anchors at (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), (6,6) fit ...

The 3 at (6,6) writes its ring of 1s exactly where the input already had 1s — allowed because the target cells equal the stamp color. The 3 at (10,10) is off-grid → skipped.

💬 Response text: Great—this third example nails a needed refinement.

Updated rule (general, color-agnostic)
- Background color = most frequent color in the grid; foreground = the other color.
- Take the largest 4-connected component of the foreground and crop to its tight bounding box B (HxW). The output size is exactly HxW.
- Draw concentric “onion” rings of foreground with 1-cell background gaps between rings:
  - Use offsets k = 0, 2, 4, … while H−2k > 0 and W−2k > 0.
  - Let the inner rectangle at offset k have size h = H−2k, w = W−2k.
    - If h > 1 and w > 1: draw its full 1-pixel-thick border.
    - If exactly one of h or w equals 1 (a 1×n or n×1 degenerate rectangle): draw only its two end “corner” cells (i.e., the two endpoints of the line), not the whole line.
    - If h = w = 1: draw that single center pixel.
- All other cells are background; ignore all other components.

Why this fits example 3
- Foreground = 9, background = 4. Largest 9-component’s B is 7×5.
- Rings at offsets 0 and 2:
  - k=0: full 7×5 border of 9s.
  - k=2: h=3, w=1 → degenerate; draw only the two endpoints in the center column (rows 3 and 5).
- Result matches the provided 7×5 output exactly.

This still reproduces examples 1 and 2 (including the single center pixel case when h=w=1). Ready to apply to a test input....

Here’s my best deterministic prediction for the second output, following the rule I inferred: keep the border bars fixed; for interior cells, push any pixel that matches a bar color toward that bar (2 up, 3 down, 4 left, 7 right), and apply upward compaction to the remaining colors (8/9). Counts are preserved and movements stop on first available cells.

💬 Response text: Example 4 matches the same “onion rings inside the main component’s box” rule.

Consolidated rule (fits all 4 trainings)
- Background = most frequent color; foreground = the other color.
- Find the largest 4-connected foreground component and take its tight bounding box B of size H×W. The output canvas is exactly H×W.
- If a dimension is even, shrink the drawing area along that dimension by 1 to make it odd (anchor at the top-left of B). This explains the extra blank columns in example 1; in the other examples H and W are already odd so there’s no slack.
- Draw concentric 1-pixel-thick foreground rectangles with 1-cell background gaps: for k = 0, 2, 4, … while h = H'−2k > 0 and w = W'−2k > 0
  - If h > 1 and w > 1: draw the full border.
  - If exactly one of h or w is 1: draw only the two endpoints of that 1×n or n×1 line.
  - If h = w = 1: draw that single center pixel.
- Everything else in the canvas is background; ignore all other components.

Why example 4 matches
- Background 2, foreground 4. Largest 4-component’s B is 9×11 (already odd).
- Rings at k=0 (9×11 border), k=2 (5×7 border), k=4 (1×3 degenerate → two endpoints).
- The result is exactly the provided 9×11 output.

Example 4 matches the same “onion rings inside the main component’s box” rule.

Consolidated rule (fits all 4 trainings)
- Background = most frequent color; foreground = the other color.
- Find the largest 4-connected foreground component and take its tight bounding box B of size H×W. The output canvas is exactly H×W.
- If a dimension is even, shrink the drawing area along that dimension by 1 to make it odd (anchor at the top-left of B). This explains the extra blank columns in example 1; in the other examples H and W are already odd so there’s no slack.
- Draw concentric 1-pixel-thick foreground rectangles with 1-cell background gaps: for k = 0, 2, 4, … while h = H'−2k > 0 and w = W'−2k > 0
  - If h > 1 and w > 1: draw the full border.
  - If exactly one of h or w is 1: draw only the two endpoints of that 1×n or n×1 line.
  - If h = w = 1: draw that single center pixel.
- Everything else in the canvas is background; ignore all other components.

Why example 4 matches

  - Its 4×4 region contains no other anchor (2/3/5/8) besides itself. If it contains another anchor anywhere, skip it. This resolves overlaps deterministically (only one of any overlapping pair places).
- Place all valid stamps; result is the union of these stamps.

Why example 4 matches:
- Anchors occur on a 4-step grid so every 4×4 is in-bounds and contains no other anchor; all stamps place.
- 2’s lay yellow hollow squares, 3’s lay blue borders-without-corners, 5’s lay magenta diagonal 2×2 corners, and 8’s lay orange corners+center. The tiling of these 4×4 stamps across the 20×20 board exactly reproduces the provided output.

This same procedure reproduces examples 1–3 (including skipping overlapping anchors like the 5 in example 1 and the (5,5) in example 3)....

Updated rule set (fits all four trainings):

- Anchors: cells with values 2, 3, 5, 8. Each is the top-left of a 4×4 stamp. All other input colors are ignored; start from a blank canvas.
- Mapping (anchor → output color/shape in its 4×4):
  - 2 → color 4: full 4×4 hollow square (border including corners).
  - 3 → color 1: border without the four corners.
  - 5 → color 6: two 2×2 blocks on the main diagonal (top-left and bottom-right).
  - 8 → color 7: four corners plus the central 2×2 block.
- Valid anchor:
  - Its 4×4 fits in-bounds, and
  - Its 4×4 region contains no other anchor (2/3/5/8) besides itself. If it contains another anchor anywhere, skip it. This resolves overlaps deterministically (only one of any overlapping pair places).
- Place all valid stamps; result is the union of these stamps.

Why example 4 matches:
- Anchors occur on a 4-step grid so every 4×4 is in-bounds and contains no other anchor; all stamps place.

Look at the visual representation below. Based on the consistent pattern you've identified from all the training examples, generate the output grid. 

You can use a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

IMPORTANT: Provide your answer as a grid in the exact same format, with square brackets and comma-separated values. Make sure the dimensions are correct.

💬 Response text: Key idea
- The red column (2) is a fixed vertical divider.
- For each row, look strictly to the left of the red column and find the rightmost non‑zero monochrome run (the contiguous block of a single color closest to the red column; it may or may not touch the column).
- Let that run’s color be C and its length be L.
- To the right of the red column, paint single cells of color C starting immediately one cell to the right of the column and then every L cells after that (i.e., positions red_col+1 + k·L), stopping at the grid edge.
- All other cells remain unchanged.

What matters
- Color identity C of the rightmost non‑zero run on the left.
- Length L of that run.
- The red column acts only as a divider; its color value doesn’t propagate.
- Absolute position of the left run (how far from the left edge or whether there’s a gap of zeros before the divider) does not matter.

Checks on the example
- Row 4: last left run = four 1s (L=4, C=1) → 1s at cols 7,11,15.
- Row 6: last left run = one 8 (L=1, C=8) → every cell on the right becomes 8.
- Row 8: last left run = five 3s (L=5, C=3) → 3s at cols 7,12.
- Row 10: last left run = four 5s (L=4, C=5) → 5s at cols 7,11,15.

You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

- Let that run’s color be C and its length be L.

💬 Response text: Refined rule (fits both training pairs)

- There are exactly two non‑background colors, call them A and B (first pair: 3 and 4; second pair: 1 and 2). The output introduces 8.

- Find “holes”: any 0 whose entire in‑bounds 3×3 neighborhood (excluding the center) is uniformly one nonzero color c. In other words, every existing neighbor is c; no neighbor is 0 or the other color. Edge cells can qualify if all existing neighbors are c.

- For each hole (center at p) in color c:
  - Set p to 8.
  - In the 3×3 window around p (excluding p), recolor only those cells that were c in the original grid to the opposite color c′. Do not paint background 0s or cells that were already c′.
  - Apply all stamps in parallel using the original grid as the mask; overlapping stamps just union their recolorings.

- Everything else remains unchanged.

Key correction from my previous attempt: rings are clipped to the original colored regions; background 0s are never overwritten by the ring. This produces the exact second output you provided and matches the first example as well....

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

Refined rule (fits both training pairs)

- There are exactly two non‑background colors, call them A and B (first pair: 3 and 4; second pair: 1 and 2). The output introduces 8.

- Find “holes”: any 0 whose entire in‑bounds 3×3 neighborhood (excluding the center) is uniformly one nonzero color c. In other words, every existing neighbor is c; no neighbor is 0 or the other color. Edge cells can qualify if all existing neighbors are c.

- For each hole (center at p) in color c:
  - Set p to 8.
  - In the 3×3 window around p (excluding p), recolor only those cells that were c in the original grid to the opposite color c′. Do not paint background 0s or cells that were already c′.
  - Apply all stamps in parallel using the original grid as the mask; overlapping stamps just union their recolorings.

- Everything else remains unchanged.

Key correction from my previous attempt: rings are clipped to the original colored regions; background 0s are never overwritten by the ring. This produces the exact second output you provided and matches the first example as well.

- Counts are preserved exactly; attachments are contiguous stacks/rows whose lengths equal the number of tokens of that color assigned to that body.

You’re right—my earlier “push-to-bars” idea was wrong. Looking at both pairs again (and visualizing), the consistent rule is:

What the puzzle is doing
- The frame colors define directions: top=T, bottom=B, left=L, right=R. In ex2: T=2, B=3, L=4, R=7. In ex1 the “middle wall” (4) also acts like a directional wall facing each room on its two sides.
- The interior contains one or more 9/8 blobs (treat 9 and 8 as the body; 9s are cores, 8s are filler).
- Interior pixels that match any frame color are tokens that must be attached to a nearby 9/8 body on the side indicated by their frame:
  - L-color tokens form a vertical stack immediately to the left of the body.
  - R-color tokens form a vertical stack immediately to the right of the body.
  - T-color tokens form a horizontal row immediately above the body.
  - B-color tokens form a horizontal row immediately below the body.
  - If there is a 2-thick wall splitting the interior (like the 4-wall in ex1), first partition the board into rooms; tokens move to the room that “owns” their direction before attachment (e.g., left-color tokens must live in the left room; right-color tokens in the right room).
- Counts are preserved exactly; attachments are contiguous stacks/rows whose lengths equal the number of tokens of that color assigned to that body.
- The 9/8 body itself is compacted (delete empty rows/cols inside its room so it sits snugly), preserving the multiset of 8s/9s and their connectivity.
- The outer frame bars themselves are unchanged.

Why this recreates the given outputs
- Ex2:
  - There are two 9/8 bodies in the interior. Token counts near the upper body: T=4 (four 2s), L=2 (two 4s), R=0, B=0. Output shows a row of four 2s above and two 4s on the left of that body; no right/bottom attachments. The two 9s of that body stack centrally, with 8s compacted around them.
  - Token counts around the lower body: L=3 (three 4s), R=3 (three 7s), B=1 (one 3), T=0. Output shows a 3-high 4-stack on the left, a 3-high 7-stack on the right, and one 3 below; 9 at the core with compacted 8s as the body.
  - All frame bars (top 2s, bottom 3s, left 4s, right 7s) remain unchanged.
- Ex1:
  - The 4-wall splits the interior into left and right rooms. There are two 9/8 bodies (one per room).
  - Tokens of the left-frame color (1) must live in the left room; the two 1s found in the right room are moved to the left room and attached on the left side of the left body (appear as the two 1s you see there).
  - Tokens of the right-frame color (2) must live in the right room; the two 2s found in the left room move to the right room and attach on the right side of the right body (appear near the top of that room).
  - Interior 4s act like wall-facing tokens: each attaches to the side of its nearby body that faces the wall (so a 4 appears on the right side of the left body and on the left side of the right body).
  - Each body’s 8/9s are compacted upward within its room. The three fixed bars (left-1s, middle-4s, right-2s) are unchanged.

If you share a third pair I can verify this formally, but with this rule I can now deterministically reconstruct both training outputs from their inputs.

💬 Response text: Working hypothesis

- The non-scattered colors (here 1, 3, 2) draw 1‑pixel “walls” that form enclosed regions (“rooms”). Noise color 5 is irrelevant to the structure.
- For each wall color c, count how many enclosed empty regions are fully bounded by c (i.e., holes in c when everything not c is treated as empty).
- Build an output grid with:
  - rows = number of wall colors,
  - columns = the maximum room count among them,
  - each row left-filled with c repeated count(c) times,
  - remaining cells in that row filled with the scatter/noise color (5).
- Row order: ascending by room count (break ties by reading order of the color’s top-left pixel if needed).

Apply to the example

- Blue (1): a simple square → 1 room → row: [1, 5, 5, 5]
- Green (3): outer rectangle with one vertical divider → 2 rooms → row: [3, 3, 5, 5]
- Red (2): outer rectangle with three vertical dividers and one extra horizontal → 4 rooms → row: [2, 2, 2, 2]
- Max rooms = 4 → width 4. Filler = 5.

This matches the provided output.

Please share the next training example so I can validate and refine this rule (especially tie ordering)....

You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them.

💬 Response text: Hypothesis after analyzing the first pair

What has semantic significance
- The big colored frame (4s, 6s, 5s) only serves to locate a “screen” inside it.
- The screen is the rectangular block whose background is 1 and that contains shapes in 8, 2, 3 plus some 0s.
- Colors are preserved; no recoloring happens.

Deterministic rule
1) Crop the screen: take the bounding box of the 1‑background region with its embedded 8/2/3/0 pixels. In this example that block is 15×11 (rows 5–19, cols 5–15 of the input).
2) Transform the cropped block by rotating 90° counter‑clockwise and then mirroring horizontally (left–right flip).
   - Equivalent coordinate rule for a block of size H×W: new_row = W+1−col, new_col = H+1−row.

Checks on this example
- The vertical column of 8s in the crop (at col 8) becomes the long horizontal bar of 8s on output row 4.
- The horizontal run of 8s (row 12 in the crop) becomes the vertical 8s in output column 4.
- The orange 2 cluster around (row 10, cols 6–7,9–10) maps to the orange L at column 6 and row 6 in the output.
- The small 0 notch at (row 1, col 8) maps to output (row 4, col 15), and the left‑edge 0s map to the bottom‑right 0s in the output.

So: output = crop the inner 1‑background panel, then rotate 90° CCW and flip horizontally....

PHASE PROMPT TO OPENAI:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Here's the first training example:

Hypothesis after analyzing the first pair

What has semantic significance
- The big colored frame (4s, 6s, 5s) only serves to locate a “screen” inside it.
- The screen is the rectangular block whose background is 1 and that contains shapes in 8, 2, 3 plus some 0s.
- Colors are preserved; no recoloring happens.

Deterministic rule
1) Crop the screen: take the bounding box of the 1‑background region with its embedded 8/2/3/0 pixels. In this example that block is 15×11 (rows 5–19, cols 5–15 of the input).
2) Transform the cropped block by rotating 90° counter‑clockwise and then mirroring horizontally (left–right flip).
   - Equivalent coordinate rule for a block of size H×W: new_row = W+1−col, new_col = H+1−row.

Checks on this example
- The vertical column of 8s in the crop (at col 8) becomes the long horizontal bar of 8s on output row 4.
- The horizontal run of 8s (row 12 in the crop) becomes the vertical 8s in output column 4.
- The orange 2 cluster around (row 10, cols 6–7,9–10) maps to the orange L at column 6 and row 6 in the output.
- The small 0 notch at (row 1, col 8) maps to output (row 4, col 15), and the left‑edge 0s map to the bottom‑right 0s in the output.

So: output = crop the inner 1‑background panel, then rotate 90° CCW and flip horizontally.

💬 Response text: Great catch. My first rule was incomplete. Here’s the refined, deterministic rule that matches both training examples:

Rule (per row)
- Let the red column (value 2) be a divider.
- Parse the segment strictly to the left of the divider into contiguous non-zero runs. For each run i, note its color Ci and length Li. Ignore zeros.
- On the right of the divider, starting at the first cell to the right, paint color Ci at positions start + k·Li (k = 0,1,2,…) within the row.
- If multiple runs paint the same cell, the run closer to the divider (the later run on the left) wins and overwrites earlier ones.

What has semantic significance
- Each non-zero run’s color and its length.
- Relative order of runs (priority: rightmost > … > leftmost).
- The red divider is just a boundary; if a 2 appears as a left run color, treat it like any other color.

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

Why the earlier miss
- I only used the last run. The correct rule uses all non-zero runs on the left, with priority given to runs closer to the divider.

Look at the visual representation below. Based on the consistent pattern you've identified from all the training examples, generate the output grid. 

You can use a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

IMPORTANT: Provide your answer as a grid in the exact same format, with square brackets and comma-separated values. Make sure the dimensions are correct.

💬 Response text: Example 3 confirms the refined rule:

Per row:
- Treat the 2-column as a divider.
- On the left of it, find all non-zero contiguous runs; for each run i with color Ci and length Li, paint Ci on the right at positions (divider+1) + k·Li (k = 0,1,2,…). If multiple runs hit the same cell, the rightmost-left run has priority.

Checks on example 3:
- Row 2: left runs = [1,1] (L=2) → 1 at cols 5,7,9,11,13,15.
- Row 6: left run = [5] (L=1) → every right cell becomes 5.
- Row 10: left run = [7,7,7] (L=3) → 7 at cols 5,8,11,14.
- Other rows have no non-zero left runs → right side unchanged.

This matches the provided output exactly. Ready for the test input....

Example 3 confirms the refined rule:

Per row:
- Treat the 2-column as a divider.
- On the left of it, find all non-zero contiguous runs; for each run i with color Ci and length Li, paint Ci on the right at positions (divider+1) + k·Li (k = 0,1,2,…). If multiple runs hit the same cell, the rightmost-left run has priority.

Checks on example 3:
- Row 2: left runs = [1,1] (L=2) → 1 at cols 5,7,9,11,13,15.
- Row 6: left run = [5] (L=1) → every right cell becomes 5.
- Row 10: left run = [7,7,7] (L=3) → 7 at cols 5,8,11,14.
- Other rows have no non-zero left runs → right side unchanged.

This matches the provided output exactly. Ready for the test input.

💬 Response text: Key observations
- There is a unique 7×7 black (0) panel in the bottom‑left of the input. It acts as a legend/template.
- In that panel, column 2 has the colors 8, 4, 2 on rows 2, 4, 6 respectively. Those rows specify which colors to count and where they should be placed in the output.
- Outside the panel, each connected component (4‑connected) of a listed color is one object. Background 3 and the 0’s of the panel are irrelevant. Ignore any occurrences of the listed colors inside the panel when counting.

Counts in this example (outside the panel)
- Color 8: 3 components (three maroon “corner” clusters).
- Color 4: 1 component (the yellow plus).
- Color 2: 2 components (two red 2×2 squares).

How to build the output
- Start with a 7×7 grid of zeros.
- For each color found in the panel at row r, place as many cells of that color in row r of the output as its count, starting at column 2 and stepping by 2 (columns 2,4,6). This matches the panel’s spacing and keeps symbols separated.

Applying this:
- Row 2 (color 8): 3 → put 8 at cols 2,4,6.
- Row 4 (color 4): 1 → put 4 at col 2.
- Row 6 (color 2): 2 → put 2 at cols 2,4.

That produces the given 7×7 output....

You are looking at a visual puzzle. I'll show you examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them.

Key observations
- There is a unique 7×7 black (0) panel in the bottom‑left of the input. It acts as a legend/template.
- In that panel, column 2 has the colors 8, 4, 2 on rows 2, 4, 6 respectively. Those rows specify which colors to count and where they should be placed in the output.
- Outside the panel, each connected component (4‑connected) of a listed color is one object. Background 3 and the 0’s of the panel are irrelevant. Ignore any occurrences of the listed colors inside the panel when counting.

Counts in this example (outside the panel)
- Color 8: 3 components (three maroon “corner” clusters).
- Color 4: 1 component (the yellow plus).
- Color 2: 2 components (two red 2×2 squares).

How to build the output
- Start with a 7×7 grid of zeros.
- For each color found in the panel at row r, place as many cells of that color in row r of the output as its count, starting at column 2 and stepping by 2 (columns 2,4,6). This matches the panel’s spacing and keeps symbols separated.

Applying this:
- Row 2 (color 8): 3 → put 8 at cols 2,4,6.
- Row 4 (color 4): 1 → put 4 at col 2.
- Row 6 (color 2): 2 → put 2 at cols 2,4.

That produces the given 7×7 output.

Look at the visual representation below. Based on the consistent pattern you've identified from all the training examples, generate the output grid. 

You can use a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

IMPORTANT: Provide your answer as a grid in the exact same format, with square brackets and comma-separated values. Make sure the dimensions are correct.

💬 Response text: Refined rule
- Find the inner rectangular “screen”: the maximal axis-aligned rectangle of a single background color that contains foreground pixels of other colors. The colors of the frame/outside are irrelevant.
- Crop exactly that screen.
- Rotate the cropped screen 90 degrees counter-clockwise. No mirroring. Colors are preserved.

Why my earlier guess failed
- I added an extra horizontal mirror. The second example shows that a plain 90° CCW rotation maps the two 8s from row 2, cols 8–9 of the crop to a vertical pair at (row 2–3, col 2) in the output, matching the ground truth.

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

💬 Response text: Great—example 3 fits the same transformation once we identify the correct “screen.”

Unified rule (now consistent across all three):
- Find the unique interior rectangular panel: the tight bounding box of a dense, mostly single-colored, non-zero region that contains other colors inside it. Colors are preserved.
- Crop exactly that panel.
- Rotate the crop 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

💬 Response text: Refined rule (fits both training examples)
- Find the rectangular “panel” of zeros. Its size (height × width) becomes the output’s size.
- Inside that panel there is a single “legend” column containing some colored cells (non‑zero). The row of each legend cell specifies the output row; the cell’s color is the color to count.
- Count, outside the panel, the number of 4‑connected components for each legend color. Ignore any occurrences in the panel itself.
- Build the output as all zeros, then for each legend color at panel row r, place as many single cells of that color in output row r as its count, starting at column 2 and stepping by 2 (2,4,6,…). Leave other cells zero.

Why my earlier miss for example 2
- I used width 9; correct width is the panel width (12). Counts were correct (2 for color 2, 2 for color 8, 4 for color 3).

If you did not produce the correct output earlier, refine your approach and use the tool to iterate. 

Remember every transformation here is deterministic and reproducible. Do not find patterns that only exist in one input while still capturing all transformations and properties of the board.

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

💬 Response text: Refined rule (works on both training examples)

- Treat one color as filler/noise: 5 in these boards.
- For every other color c, consider only the cells of color c as 1‑pixel walls. Everything not c is empty (including other colors and 0).
- Count the number of holes in c’s wall set using 4‑connectivity: flood fill the complement from the outside; any remaining enclosed empty components are “rooms” of c.
- Build the output:
  - Width = max room count over all colors.
  - One row per color c, sorted by ascending room count; break ties by ascending color value.
  - Row = c repeated room_count(c) times, then padded with the filler color (5) to the chosen width.

Validated with the tool

- Example 1 holes: 1→1, 3→2, 2→4 → output rows [1,5,5,5], [3,3,5,5], [2,2,2,2].
- Example 2 holes (visualized each mask to verify enclosures):
  - 8→1 (one closed chamber between its two verticals and the bottom/top segments)
  - 1→2
  - 2→3
  - 4→3
  - 3→4
  Sorted by count (ties by color value) gives:
  [8,5,5,5]
  [1,1,5,5]
  [2,2,2,5]
  [4,4,4,5]
  [3,3,3,3]
  which matches the provided output.

Key clarifications
- Connectivity is 4-connected.
- Other colored walls do not block when counting holes for c (they are treated as empty); only c’s pixels define c’s rooms.
- The filler color is used only for padding output rows....

Symbols may have semantic significants; properties of the symbols may convey this semantic significants. You need to find what properties carry semantic significance and what properties do not contribute to decision making. 

Compositional reasoning and turn-by-turn application of rules may be important. You may have to apply one transformation to allow the others to make sense. You can try using a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

Some rules have to be applied based on context. Do not fixate of superficial patterns; find what properties have semantic significance and use those as context. Some attributes or properties may not be related; if they aren't consistent across all inputs, don't focus on them. 

Continue iterating until the tool generates the correct outputs in both training examples.

Refined rule (works on both training examples)

- Treat one color as filler/noise: 5 in these boards.
- For every other color c, consider only the cells of color c as 1‑pixel walls. Everything not c is empty (including other colors and 0).
- Count the number of holes in c’s wall set using 4‑connectivity: flood fill the complement from the outside; any remaining enclosed empty components are “rooms” of c.
- Build the output:
  - Width = max room count over all colors.
  - One row per color c, sorted by ascending room count; break ties by ascending color value.
  - Row = c repeated room_count(c) times, then padded with the filler color (5) to the chosen width.

Validated with the tool

- Example 1 holes: 1→1, 3→2, 2→4 → output rows [1,5,5,5], [3,3,5,5], [2,2,2,2].
- Example 2 holes (visualized each mask to verify enclosures):
  - 8→1 (one closed chamber between its two verticals and the bottom/top segments)
  - 1→2
  - 2→3
  - 4→3
  - 3→4
  Sorted by count (ties by color value) gives:
  [8,5,5,5]
  [1,1,5,5]
  [2,2,2,5]
  [4,4,4,5]
  [3,3,3,3]
  which matches the provided output.

Key clarifications
- Connectivity is 4-connected.
- Other colored walls do not block when counting holes for c (they are treated as empty); only c’s pixels define c’s rooms.
- The filler color is used only for padding output rows.

💬 Response text: Great — this third example fits the same rule, with the only refinement being how we pick the padding/filler color.

Consolidated rule
- For each nonzero color c, treat only c as walls (4-connected, 1-pixel thick). Everything not c (including other colors) is empty.
- Count rooms(c): the number of enclosed empty components after an outside flood-fill of the complement of c.
- Wall colors are those with rooms(c) > 0. The output has one row per wall color.
- Sort rows by ascending rooms(c); break ties by ascending color value.
- Width = max_c rooms(c).
- Filler color f = the most frequent nonzero color with rooms(c) = 0. Pad each row with f to the chosen width.

Example 3 check
- rooms(8) = 1
- rooms(1) = 2
- rooms(2) = 3
- rooms(4) = 4
- rooms(7) = 0 → filler
- Max rooms = 4 → width 4
- Output:
  [8, 7, 7, 7]
  [1, 1, 7, 7]
  [2, 2, 2, 7]
  [4, 4, 4, 4]

This matches. Ready to apply to the test puzzle....

Look at the visual representation below. Based on the consistent pattern you've identified from all the training examples, generate the output grid. 

You can use a tool to generate an image of the data and analyse that along the way. Try making incremental changes to the board and looking at the results by using the visualization tool. 

IMPORTANT: Provide your answer as a grid in the exact same format, with square brackets and comma-separated values. Make sure the dimensions are correct.
